This directory contains a basic scaffolding to serve as the basis for creating a new chart.

Steps:
- Find and replace all instances of `CHART_NAME` with the name of your chart.
- Edit manifests in `CHART_NAME/templates` to suit your chart.
- Edit `Chart.yaml` with your chart information.
- Edit `values.yaml` with your chart parameters and default values.
- Edit `README.md` with your chart documentation.

⚠️ Take into account this is just an example to follow. You can make adjustments to the chart structure as you see fit.
