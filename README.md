## How to add the chart repo

1. Add the repo to your local helm client:

    ```sh
    helm repo add mika https://irfanhakim-as.github.io/charts
    ```

2. Update the repo to retrieve the latest versions of the packages:

    ```sh
    helm repo update
    ```

## How to install or upgrade a chart release

1. Get the values file of the chart you wish to install or an existing installation (release).

    Get the latest chart values file for a new installation:

    ```sh
    helm show values mika/${helmChart} > values.yaml
    ```

    Alternatively, get the values file of an existing release:

    ```sh
    helm get values ${releaseName} --namespace ${namespace} > values.yaml
    ```

    Replace `${helmChart}`, `${releaseName}`, and `${namespace}` accordingly.

2. Edit your chart values file with the intended configurations:

    ```sh
    nano values.yaml
    ```

    Pay extra attention to the descriptions and sample values provided in the chart values file.

3. Install a new release for the desired chart or upgrade an existing release:

    ```sh
    helm upgrade --install ${releaseName} mika/${helmChart} --namespace ${namespace} --create-namespace --values values.yaml --wait
    ```

    Replace `${releaseName}`, `${helmChart}`, and `${namespace}` accordingly.

4. Verify that your chart release has been installed:

    ```sh
    helm ls --namespace ${namespace} | grep "${releaseName}"
    ```

    Replace `${namespace}` and `${releaseName}` accordingly. This should return the release information if the release has been installed.

## How to uninstall a chart release

> [!CAUTION]  
> Uninstalling a release will irreversibly delete all the resources associated with the release, including any persistent data.

1. Uninstall the desired release:

    ```sh
    helm uninstall ${releaseName} --namespace ${namespace} --wait
    ```

    Replace `${releaseName}` and `${namespace}` accordingly.

2. Verify that the release has been uninstalled:

    ```sh
    helm ls --namespace ${namespace} | grep "${releaseName}"
    ```

    Replace `${namespace}` and `${releaseName}` accordingly. This should return nothing if the release has been uninstalled.
