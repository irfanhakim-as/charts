## How to install a chart

### Prepare chart values

Install the desired chart. Replace `$release_name`, `$helm_chart` and `$namespace` accordingly.

```sh
helm install $release_name mika/$helm_chart --namespace $namespace --create-namespace --values values.yaml --wait
```

Verify that your chart has been installed. Replace `$namespace` and `$release_name` accordingly.

```sh
helm ls --namespace $namespace | grep "$release_name"
```

## How to upgrade a chart

After making any necessary changes to the `values.yaml` file, upgrade the desired chart. Replace `$release_name`, `$helm_chart` and `$namespace` accordingly.

```sh
helm upgrade $release_name mika/$helm_chart --namespace $namespace --values values.yaml --wait
```

## How to uninstall a chart
